This ability enables AI systems to learn, reason, plan and act in the real world in order to assist humans [LeCun, 2022]. Intelligent systems that need to act in the real world includes wearable devices and robots [Fung et al., 2025]. Machine learning tasks that make up for this ability include captioning, retrieval, visual question answering, action tracking, reasoning and planning etc [Bordes et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2025b]. Systems for such real-world applications must have real-time response with low latency and inference cost. Currently, the common approach to achieve these tasks is to use large token-generative Vision Language Models (VLMs) [Liu et al., 2023, Dai et al., 2023, Alayrac et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2024b, Cho et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2022], which takes visual input 𝑋𝑉, textual query 𝑋𝑄to generate desired textual response 𝑌autoregressively in token space, i.e., (𝑋𝑉, 𝑋𝑄) ↦→𝑌. This is straightforward but inadequate for two main reasons. First, VLMs are expensive to develop, because they are trained to generate responses 𝑌 to queries by capturing both task-relevant semantics with task-irrelevant surface linguistic features such as words choice, style or paraphrasing. During training, VLMs must model both aspects, which results in unnecessary Predictor L XQ XV Y X-Encoder Y-Encoder SY Textual Query Visual Input Textual Target ŜY SV Y-Decoder Figure 1.

Second, real-time tasks involving live streaming video (e.g., live action tracking) require sparse and selective decoding (e.g.,, emitting a description only when a new event occurs) [Zhou et al., 2024]. However, VLMs rely on autoregressive token-by-token decoding, which must be completed before revealing the underlying semantics of 𝑌. This process introduces unnecessary latency and hampers the ability to update semantics dynamically in real time.

VL-JEPA is trained with two\nstages. The first query-free pretraining stage aims to es-\ntablish robust vision-language alignment using massive\ncaption data. We use PLM-Image-Auto [Cho et al., 2025],\nDatacomp [Gadre et al., 2023] and YFCC-100M [Thomee\net al., 2016] for image-text data. For video-text data, we\ninclude PLM-Video-Auto [Cho et al., 2025], Ego4D atomic\naction descriptions [Grauman et al., 2022], and an inter-\nnal dataset Action100M consisting captions generated on\nHowTo100M videos [Chen et al., 2025b].\nWe first do image-only training on Datacomp and YFCC-\n100M with only 1 frame per visual input, which allows us\nto use a large batch size of 24k. After 100k iterations, the\nmodel has seen 2B samples and achieved 61.6% ImageNet\nzero-shot accuracy (without prompt ensembling). Then,\nwe continue with joint image-video pretraining with 16\nframes per input. The pretraining takes 2 weeks using\n24 nodes with 8×NVIDIA H200 GPUs each. We adopt\na constant learning rate of 5×10−5 to facilitate extended\ntraining. We call the resulting model VL-JEPABASE and\nmeasure zero-shot classification and retreival performance\nwith this model.\nSupervised Finetuning. The second query-conditioned\nsupervised finetuning (SFT) stage empowers VL-JEPA\nVQA capabilities while maintaining the pretrained vision-\nlanguage alignment for classification and retrieval. The\ntraining data is selected from the PLM data mixture [Cho\net al., 2025], including 25M VQA samples, 2.8M captioning\nsamples, 1.8M classification samples, and downsampled\npretraining stage data to avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nWe train the model for 35k steps with a batch size of\n6k (∼2 days with 24 nodes), with cosine learning rate an-\nnealing applied to improve convergence. Since excessive\nhuman labelled data is included in this SFT data mixture,\nwe no longer emphasize zero-shot evaluation for the result-\ning VL-JEPASFT from this stage. Instead, we evaluate VQA\ncapabilities and compare it with state-of-the-art specialist\nmodels.\n4", "clean_text": "VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-language Sec 1: Intro | Sec 2: Method | Sec 3: Implementation | Sec 4: Experiments | Sec 5: Related Works | Sec 6: Conclusion generation tasks, such as captioning or open-ended VQA, the query 𝑋𝑄is a captioning prompt or a question, and the predictor learns to predict the embedding of the target output, ˆ𝑆𝑌, which is then decoded into text. VL-JEPA also supports CLIP-style open-vocabulary classification and discriminative VQA, where candidate label texts are encoded into embeddings and compared with prediction ˆ𝑆𝑌to select the nearest match. For text-to-video retrieval, candidate videos are mapped to their predicted embeddings ˆ𝑆𝑌using a retrieval a captioning prompt, and then ranked by similarity to the encoded textual retrieval query. Selective Decoding. Real-world video applications often require online streaming inference, such as tracking user actions in smart glasses for procedural assistance [Chen et al., 2024c], monitoring world states for online planning, navigation and robotics [Shukor et al., 2025, Black et al., 2025, Song et al., 2025]. A central challenge is balancing two competing needs: the model must continuously update semantics as new frames arrive, but computational efficiency and latency are critical. Existing VLMs typically rely on explicit memory mechanisms [Zhou et al., 2024, Qian et al., 2024] to decide when to decode or complex KV-cache optimizations [Di et al., 2025] for efficiency, since autoregressive language models are expensive to run continuously. VL-JEPA, in contrast, natively supports selective decoding. Since it predicts a semantic answer embedding non-autoregressively, the model provides a continuous semantic stream of ˆ𝑆𝑌that can be monitored in real time. This stream can be stabilized with simple smoothing (e.g., average pooling) and decoded only when a significant semantic shift is detected, such as when the local window variance exceeds a threshold. In this way, VL-JEPA maintains always-on semantic monitoring while avoiding unnecessary decoding, achieving both responsiveness and efficiency. 3 Implementation of VL-JEPA 3.1 Model Architecture X-Encoder. Unless otherwise specified, we use a frozen V-JEPA 2 ViT-L [Assran et al., 2025] with 304M parameters, a self-supervised vision model that excels at both image and video tasks. Each video input is uniformly sampled into frames at 2562 resolution. For image inputs, the same image is duplicated to match the input shape. Predictor. The predictor is initialized with the last 8 Transformer layers of Llama-3.2-1B, resulting in 490M trainable parameters. The text tokenizer and token embedding are also from Llama-3.2-1B. We allow maximum 512 query tokens, and put [PAD] tokens for short queries. We disable the causal attention mask so that both vision and query embeddings can be jointly attended. Linear projections connect the predictor with the vision and text embeddings, and average pooling on non-[PAD] tokens is applied to obtain the predicted target embedding. Y-Encoder. We use EmbeddingGemma-300M [Vera et al., 2025] as the initialization of the Y-Encoder. We set maximum context length of 512 to handle detailed captions. We found that setting a learning rate multiplier of ×0.05 to all text encoder parameters improves performance, since the quality of embedding prediction would be suboptimal in the beginning of training. Linear projection head is applied to both Predictor and Y-Encoder, obtaining a shared embedding space with 1,536 dimensions, where the loss is calculated. 3.2 Two-stage Training Large-scale Pretraining. VL-JEPA is trained with two stages. The first query-free pretraining stage aims to establish robust vision-language alignment using massive caption data. We use PLM-Image-Auto [Cho et al., 2025], Datacomp [Gadre et al., 2023] and YFCC-100M [Thomee et al., 2016] for image-text data. For video-text data, we include PLM-Video-Auto [Cho et al., 2025], Ego4D atomic action descriptions [Grauman et al., 2022], and an internal dataset Action100M consisting captions generated on HowTo100M videos [Chen et al., 2025b]. We first do image-only training on Datacomp and YFCC100M with only 1 frame per visual input, which allows us to use a large batch size of 24k. After 100k iterations, the model has seen 2B samples and achieved 61.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy (without prompt ensembling). Then, we continue with joint image-video pretraining with 16 frames per input. The pretraining takes 2 weeks using 24 nodes with 8×NVIDIA H200 GPUs each. We adopt a constant learning rate of 5×10−5 to facilitate extended training. We call the resulting model VL-JEPABASE and measure zero-shot classification and retreival performance with this model. Supervised Finetuning. The second query-conditioned supervised finetuning (SFT) stage empowers VL-JEPA VQA capabilities while maintaining the pretrained visionlanguage alignment for classification and retrieval. The training data is selected from the PLM data mixture [Cho et al., 2025], including 25M VQA samples, 2.8M captioning samples, 1.8M classification samples, and downsampled pretraining stage data to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We train the model for 35k steps with a batch size of 6k (∼2 days with 24 nodes), with cosine learning rate annealing applied to improve convergence. Since excessive human labelled data is included in this SFT data mixture, we no longer emphasize zero-shot evaluation for the resulting VL-JEPASFT from this stage. Instead, we evaluate VQA capabilities and compare it with state-of-the-art specialist models. 4"}

We demonstrate application of VL-\nJEPA for understanding the relationship between world\nstate changes and action concepts (i.e., inverse dynamics) in\n§4.3. In §4.4, we demonstrate the advantage of embedding\nprediction by comparing it with a token-predictive VLM\nbaseline under a strictly controlled setting. In §4.5, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of VL-JEPA’s selective decoding,\nand show that it reduces decoding cost while maintaining\nthe performance. Next, we analyze VL-JEPA’s Y-Encoder\nin §4.6.\nEvaluation Setup. We evaluate VL-JEPA following the\nCLIP-style evaluation protocol (see Fig.2 and §2 “Multi-\ntasking”). We assess VL-JEPA on a broad suite of bench-\nmarks, including 8 classification datasets and 8 retrieval\ndatasets. For zero-shot evaluation, we compare against\ngeneralist foundation models CLIP [Radford et al., 2021],\nSigLIP2 [Tschannen et al., 2025], and Perception Encoder\n(PE-Core)[Bolya et al., 2025].

In this section, we compare VL-JEPA to\na token-generative VLM baseline under a strictly aligned\ntraining conditions. Both models use the same Perception\nEncoder [Bolya et al., 2025] (frozen ViT-L-14 with 3362\nresolution, no tiling, 16 frames per video) for vision inputs.\nWe use the same training iterations with the same effective\nbatch size of 128, same learning rate scheduler on the same\npretraining data mixture described above (§3). The only\ndifference is the prediction task: VL-JEPA predicts target\nembeddings [Duquenne et al., 2023] using a 0.5B predictor,\nwhereas the VLM baseline performs next-token prediction\nwith cross-entropy using a 1B LLM. For VLM, we use the\nstandard training recipe and codebase of PerceptionLM\n[Cho et al., 2025], aligning frozen vision encoder and text-\nonly LLM Llama-3.2-1B. For VL-JEPA, we initialize the\npredictor from the 8-16 layers of Llama-3.2-1B.\nWe evaluate both models at regular checkpoints through-\nout training spanning from 500K to 15M samples seen. At\neach checkpoint, we measure the performance on video\ncaptioning and video classification. For video captioning,\nwe report CIDEr scores averaged across YouCook2 [Zhou\net al., 2018], MSR-VTT [Xu et al., 2016] and PVD-Bench\n[Bolya et al., 2025]. VL-JEPA decodes the predicted embed-\ndings while VLM generates the tokens directly. For video\nclassification, we report top-5 accuracy averaged across\nCrossTask-Step, CrossTask-Task [Zhukov et al., 2019] and\nEgoExo4D [Grauman et al., 2024]. For VL-JEPA we choose\nthe candidate with lowest cosine distance to the predicted\nembedding, while for VLM we pick the class with lowest\nperplexity.\nResults.

We compare Y-Encoders from different models\nby computing the cosine similarity for all description pairs.\nWe check that the similarity between positives 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑝1, 𝑝2)\nis higher than both the similarity between each positive\nand the negative 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑝1, 𝑛) and 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑝2, 𝑛).

Our goal at this stage, is not to propose a universal alternative to VLMs, as this would require broader evaluation on tasks such as reasoning, tool use, and agentic behaviors where current token generative VLMs excel. Finally, although our results show clear benefits from scaling parameters and dataset size, we did not fully explore this direction, leaving it for future work.
