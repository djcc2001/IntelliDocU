    "type": "fact",
    "answer": "The main contribution of the Flex scene encoder presented in the paper is its design specifically for vision-language-action (VLA) models, which allows it to compress image tokens into a compact set of scene tokens while leveraging mutual information across different camera views and timesteps to provide a holistic scene representation. This approach outperforms other methods that do not consider these factors.",

    "type": "fact",
    "answer": "Flex achieves a significant reduction in the computational load for policy models in autonomous driving systems by leveraging multi-camera encoding techniques to efficiently process visual data from multiple cameras simultaneously. This allows for faster inference and decision-making processes without compromising accuracy, thereby improving overall system performance and efficiency.",
